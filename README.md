This GitHub repository showcases projects I developed as part of my Data Analytics & Visualization Certificate program at the University of Minnesota. This portfolio demonstrate skills in Python, SQL, ETL, machine learning, javascript, api, and data visualization, among other data analytics skills.

Included are projects brought in from my non-profit experience from Cradle 2 Career, and a machine learning project on NFL 1st down conversion prediction
